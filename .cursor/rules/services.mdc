# System services

- Always check server [swagger.json](mdc:server/swagger.json) to make sure that you are writing the correct query or mutation
- Always search on codebase to be sure that you aren't rewriting a query
- Search on codebase to make sure that you are writing services layer in the same way that each other
- Avoid creating multiple-fetch mutations
