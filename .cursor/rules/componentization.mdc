# Reusable components

- Always think if the component or page that you are writing should be a separate component to be reusable in the future
- Avoid creating large components or pages, break it into smaller components and prefer to keep each component logic and queries inside itself
- Try to use system codebase interfaces, types and enums to create components interfaces
- Always search on codebase to make sure that you aren't rewriting an existing component
- You can break components to make more reusable parts if necessary
